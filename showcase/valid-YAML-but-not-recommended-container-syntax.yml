diagram:
    .box: |
        This box won't be
        rendered because it's
        overwritten by the
        last entry of `diagram`
    .box.dashed: a box with dashes
    .box: |
        This `.box` overrides
        the first `.box`

# This has the same result as:
# diagram:
#     .box.dashed: a box with dashes
#     .box: |
#         This `.box` overrides
#         the first `.box`
